Don't get me wrong
I went along for the madness
Two of a kind
A match lit with heaven and sadness
But oh what rings will bring us to

Don't make it seem like I walked away
Don't ever doubt my desire
I took a beating, I took your love
Like a fighter

I'm sorry, my love
But the wings of a dove were the answer
Insecurity sucks at the breast of a patient
Disaster
But oh the kiss that hits so true
